**Summary**

This analysis will display the different types of factors that make a Disney movie. In this data set  the genre, MPPA rating and year made play a significant role in the gross profits. I want to take these data points into a deeper understanding of the shifts throughout the years in movies and how it could possibly affect the future of disney movies to maximize profits.
