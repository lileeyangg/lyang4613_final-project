These are just some specific customization and improvements you can incorporate in your `.Rmd` files. More information may be found at <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html>


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Buttons/Tabs for Sub-sections {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Save space in your document using buttons or tabs for sub-sections. Below is the way this Section was defined

```
# Buttons/Tabs for Sub-sections {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
```

***

## First Section
A first section

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       aes(x=reorder(class, hwy), y=hwy, fill=class)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(legend.position="none")
```


## Second Section
content of sub-chapter #2

$$
x^2 + y^ 2 = r^2
$$

## Third Section
content of sub-chapter #3

```{r}
set.seed(217)
sample_n(tbl = mpg, size = 4)
```



# Automatic Numbering

You can modify the YAML in your `.Rmd` to automatically the sections and sub-sections in your document. This example already does that. For example, your header would look like:

```
---
title: "Your title"
output: 
  html_document:
    number_sections: TRUE
---
```


# Highlight a piece of text {#highlight}


You can apply some `css` to a specific part of your document. For example, it may be useful to highlight conclusions at the end of your document.

The code below generates a list with highlighted items:

```
<style>
div.blue { background-color:#E6E6FA; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">
- We love data
- This was a good class
</div>
```

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#E6E6FA; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">
- We love data
- This was a good class
</div>


# Table of Contents

This example has a table of contents _floating_ on the side. For this, the YAML looks like: 

```
title: "Habits"
output:
  html_notebook:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    toc_depth: 2
```

# Skip a line

This is done using the `<br>` command. This `.Rmd` code:

```
Rei Sanchez-Arias
<br><br><br><br>
Data Science and Business Analytics
```

will produce: 

Rei Sanchez-Arias
<br><br><br><br>
Data Science and Business Analytics


# Centering Images

You could use the code below 

```
<center>
![Site logo](https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/icon-192.png)
</center>
```

<center>
![Site logo](https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/icon-192.png)
</center>

<br><br>
Another approach is to use the `knitr::includegraphics()` function, and determine the options of the chunk of code specifying `fig.align='center'` (should work well for a R Markdown file)

```{r, fig.align='center'}
# knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/reisanar/figs/raw/master/icon-192.png")
```




# Internal Links

You can use internal links in R Markdown using _anchors_. For example, this link will bring you to the previous chapter. To do it:

1 - Put an anchor next to a title. This is how one of the previous section title looks like:

```
# Highlight a piece of text {#highlight}
```

2. Put a link to an anchor:
